# HitTower.jl
Data processing domain specific language (DSL) that acts like an intermediate language.

E.g. SAS Language -> HitTower -> PySpark

E.g. SAS -> [Substrait](https://substrait.io/spec/specification/) -> PySpark


Unlikely to be worked on for a couple of years. But hey, that's how {disk.frame} started too and it's now a Top 100 R package by Github star count.

## Why the name "HitTower"?
Data in pinyin would output 打塔 as one of the options which would transliterate to Hit Tower.
